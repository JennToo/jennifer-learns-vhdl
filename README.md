In this repo I implement some basic designs in VHDL. To both learn the language
itself as well as the general principles of digital hardware design.

[For the toolchain I use OSS tools][tlc]. GHDL for simulation and (partial)
synthesis, and yosys / nextpnr / trellis for making the bitstreams. I'm
targetting a ULX3S dev board, since it's well supported by the open source EDA
tools.
